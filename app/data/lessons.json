      "content": "A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. Think of it like a notebook that everyone can read, but no one can erase or change what's already written.\n\nKey characteristics:\n• Decentralized - No single entity controls it\n• Transparent - All transactions are visible\n• Immutable - Once recorded, data cannot be altered\n• Secure - Uses cryptography to protect data",
      "keyTakeaways": [
        "Blockchain is a digital ledger distributed across many computers",
